How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It allowed me to quickly spot the mispelled words.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It can help you see the changes made either good or bad.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pro is it gives you the freedom to only save a file when you actually want to and will find meaning when looking at the history of the code.  Cons you can forget to save and lose a lot of valuable work, especially during a power failure.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is made for coding while Google Docs is made for a single independent document.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can quickly search for a version of code and using the diff command see what changed from one verison to the other.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A lot more confident knowing that you can quickly and esaily revert back and compare the differences of an older verison of code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Nothing comes to mind right now.
